                  <div id="divWhoWeAreContent" style="display:none;">Traditional Chinese pastries hold a special place in the hearts of the Chinese people, a unique heritage where each pastry has its roots in our culture, such as eating the tang yuan (汤圆) to mark the beginning of Winter and the rice cake (年糕) during Chinese New Year to imply plentiful harvest. The mooncake (月饼), especially, brings to mind a time of reunion with loved ones under the mid-Autumn full moon. <br /><br />
                  WuGuFeng is a hallmark of the rich Hong Kong pastry-making tradition, which has been renowned since the 50's for their finesse in crafting perfect parcels of baked goods. Leveraging on this heritage of more than 60 years, WuGuFeng cleverly infuses the city's cosmopolitan lifestyle and the charm of old-time flavours  into its pastries. The brand exquisitely embodies the traditional cultural spirit of oriental pastry craft, divinely integrating it with the taste of the locals to create delightfully enticing confections.  <br /><br />
